⚖️ AI Bias Inspector
🧠 Detect • Measure • Mitigate Bias in ML Models










🚀 Overview

AI Bias Inspector is a lightweight full-stack application that helps you:

🔍 Detect bias in machine learning models
📊 Measure fairness using standard metrics
🛡️ Mitigate bias before deployment

Even if you remove sensitive features like gender, models can still learn bias via proxy variables (e.g., income, age). This tool uncovers and fixes that.

✨ Features
📂 Upload any CSV dataset
🧪 Train models with/without sensitive attributes
📊 Fairness metrics:
Selection Rate
Demographic Parity
Equal Opportunity
🛡️ Bias mitigation using ThresholdOptimizer
📈 Before vs After comparison
⬇️ Export bias reports (JSON)
🌌 Animated UI (Three.js background)
🎨 Glassmorphism + smooth animations
